# EKF

This project uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the position of a mobile robot on simulated rugged terrain. The EKF uses the system function of the robot as well as the observation functions of the IMU and GPS onboard the mobile robot to estimate the position of the robot driving on rugged terrain.
